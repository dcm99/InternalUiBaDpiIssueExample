# WixToolset InternalUIBootstrapperApplication High DPI Issue
This example creates an MSI file that is bundled with wix burn.
If you open the MSI file on a monitor with a high DPI setting, the UI will be scaled correctly.
If you start the installation via the Burn bundle, the UI is displayed too small.
